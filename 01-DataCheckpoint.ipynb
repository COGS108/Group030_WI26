    "**Dataset Name:** Billboard Hot 100 Year-End Singles (2015–2025)\n",
    "> This dataset will be our primary data that we will analyze to explore our research question for this project. We obtained this dataset through a series of intermediate steps. First, we decided to adopt a divide and conquer approach to minimize errors and maintain organization of the data. We split the data collection process among each member, making 5 individual CSV files that each contained a specific year range. For instance, the first CSV has data from 2015–2017, while the second has data from 2018–2019, etc. Since our research question involves examining genres, release seasons, song tempo, and music video presence, we had to use multiple sources to curate the data for each of these additional variables. This included Wikipedia for the Billboard charts, release dates and genre, YouTube for the official music videos, and finally SongBPM to identify the tempo for each song. In addition to this, we cross-referenced the information with other credible sources to ensure we were collecting accurate data. Each CSV was identically structured and built using the same collection techniques to prevent member bias and inconsistencies. After curating all 5 CSV files, we merged them into one master dataset, which we will use for the rest of the project duration.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Link to the dataset:** [insert Google Sheet link]\n",
    "* **Number of observations:** 1,100\n",
    "* **Number of variables:** 8 (Rank, Title, Artist, Year, BPM, Genre, Release Date, Music Video)\n",
    "* **Most relevant variables:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * **BPM:** Tracks a song’s tempo using beats per minute as a unit of measurement, defining the speed of the music (fast indicates a more energetic song while slow indicates a calmer song). In this project, a song having a tempo ranging 120 BPM or higher will be considered upbeat, high-energy music.\n",
    "    * **Genre:** Classifies songs based on overlapping musical characteristics (such as its instruments, rhythm, and mood). This dataset categorizes songs into the main umbrella categories of music, namely Pop, Hip-Hop, R&B, and Country as the dominant genres. This project will focus on charting songs that fall under the Pop genre. \n",
    "    * **Release Date:** Displays when a song was first released into the music industry. Since this project focuses on the season a song is released, we will convert these dates and categorize them based on whether they fall under spring, summer, fall, or winter. \n",
    "    * **Music Video:** Indicates whether a song has an associated official music video on YouTube (1 for Yes, 0 for No).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shortcomings:** Genres are a nuanced topic, where a song can be classified into numerous subcategories or contain mixtures of various genres. Therefore, our dataset is a more simplified version of the song’s characteristics, where we focus on categorizing the music based on the broader umbrella genres. Regarding release dates, due to some songs having newer versions or being re-released in more recent albums, the dataset displays the release date of the song depending on which version and from which album the song charted. For instance, if an older version of the song hit the charts compared to its updated one, we will list the release date of the older one. Similar to genres, music videos are also becoming more diverse and exclusive regarding what counts as a music video for a song. To simplify the data collection process for this project, we did not take into account lyric videos and mainly focused on the presence of more standard, traditional song music videos. Additionally, we referenced the actual video title to see if it explicitly includes the phrase “Music Video” to help us further determine whether we should count the song as having a music video or not.

    "2. Write a few paragraphs about this dataset. Make sure to cover\n",
    "   1. Describe the important metrics, what units they are in, and giv some sense of what they mean.  For example \"Fasting blood glucose in units of mg glucose per deciliter of blood.  Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "    1. load the dataset \n",

    "    3. demonstrate the size of the dataset\n",
    "    4. find out how much data is missing, where its missing, and if its missing at random or seems to have any systematic relationships in its missingness\n",
    "    5. find and flag any outliers or suspicious entries\n",
    "    6. clean the data or demonstrate that it was already clean.  You may choose how to deal with missingness (dropna of fillna... how='any' or 'all') and you should justify your choice in some way\n",
    "    7. You will load raw data from `data/00-raw/`, you will (optionally) write intermediate stages of your work to `data/01-interim` and you will write the final fully wrangled version of your data to `data/02-processed`\n",
    "4. Optionally you can also show some summary statistics for variables that you think are important to the project\n",
