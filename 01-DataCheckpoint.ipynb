    "What determines the ranking of Pop songs in renowned music lists like the Billboard Hot 100 Year-End Charts? Through our investigation, we hope to identify potential factors that may be associated with chart positions of these top songs. Can a song’s BPM indicate a higher ranking? What about the presence of an official music video? Is it more likely for a song to gain more popularity if it is released in the summer over the winter? By answering these questions, we aim to explore what characteristics drive chart placements of Pop songs, one of the largest and most diverse genres in the music industry. \n",

    "In past research conducted by Nunes and Ordanini (2014)<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a><sup><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">1</a></sup>, they examined how the type of instrumentation in a Pop song affects their success on music charts. Specifically, they analyzed data from the Billboard Hot 100 Weekly Charts spanning 55 years, comparing number-one singles with songs that never climbed above rank 90 to determine what factors made number-one hits. Using Qualitative Comparative Analysis and Quantitative Regression techniques, Nunes and Ordanini found that the presence of background vocals was a necessary component consistently seen in number-one ranking Pop songs. Furthermore, their results suggested that in the 1960s and late 2000s, songs with relatively few instruments ranked higher in the charts. On the other hand, songs with relatively many instruments ranked higher during the 1970s–1990s. They also proposed that the songs that ranked number one on music charts like the Billboard Hot 100 were typically unique, set apart from the current era of music trends. These findings indicate that specific musical features can play a critical role in chart performance, which informs our investigation into how additional factors like tempo, release season, and official music video presence may also be associated with higher Billboard rankings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a similar study, Kim and Oh (2021)<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a><sup><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">2</a></sup> examined the relationship between certain audio features and a song’s success on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. They analyzed over 6,000 songs that appeared on the weekly charts between 1998 and 2016, and used regression analysis and predictive modeling to find patterns in the music that made a difference in chart performance. Their results showed that songs that felt more energetic and easy to dance to were more likely to reach the top 10. In particular, tracks with a steady and powerful beat often ranked higher on the charts. They also discovered that songs with a positive mood tended to perform better than those that sounded dark or melancholic. These uplifting songs seemed to connect more quickly with listeners and remain popular for longer periods of time. The study further indicated that timbre could also make an impact, as songs with clearer or more distinctive sounds were more likely to stand out and achieve higher chart rankings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both studies above help shape how we think about our own research. Nunes and Ordanini focused more on musical structure, like how background vocals or instruments relate to chart success over time. Kim and Oh looked closely at how things like danceability and happiness affect chart performance. While these studies help show that the features inside a song matter, they don’t explore outside factors such as what time of year the song came out, or whether it has an official music video that may have increased its popularity. That’s where our project comes in. We’re combining factors including tempo, release season, and the presence of music videos to see how these things work together to influence a song’s ranking on the Billboard Hot 100 Year-End charts from 2015 to 2025. And in contrast to these previous studies, which focused on weekly charts and short-term song success, our study examines long-term chart success for Pop songs by analyzing Year-End charts instead.\n",

   "source": [
    "We predict that Pop songs with summer release dates, official YouTube music videos, and faster tempos are positively associated with higher Billboard yearly chart rankings from 2015 to 2025. Compared to those without videos, songs that have trending music videos may increase engagement and listening rates. Additionally, because summer is a socially active and highly favored season during which listeners often prefer upbeat, energetic music, Pop songs released during this period with faster tempos might gain more popularity, placing better ranks on lists such as the Billboard Hot 100 Year-End Charts."

    "### Data Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset Name:** Billboard Hot 100 Year-End Singles (2015–2025)\n",
    "> This dataset will be our primary data that we will analyze to explore our research question for this project. We obtained this dataset through a series of intermediate steps. First, we decided to adopt a divide and conquer approach to minimize errors and maintain organization of the data. We split the data collection process among each member, making 5 individual CSV files that each contained a specific year range. For instance, the first CSV has data from 2015–2017, while the second has data from 2018–2019, etc. Since our research question involves examining genres, release seasons, song tempo, and music video presence, we had to use multiple sources to curate the data for each of these additional variables. This included Wikipedia for the Billboard charts, release dates and genre, YouTube for the official music videos, and finally SongBPM to identify the tempo for each song. In addition to this, we cross-referenced the information with other credible sources to ensure we were collecting accurate data. Each CSV was identically structured and built using the same collection techniques to prevent member bias and inconsistencies. After curating all 5 CSV files, we merged them into one master dataset, which we will use for the rest of the project duration.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Link to the dataset:** [Master Dataset (Google Sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13CpMHXhd6jVaWsLLfy1u--CaLFGUEoVZgCiG0Qv9hQA/edit?gid=0#gid=0)\n",
    "* **Number of observations:** 1,100\n",
    "* **Number of variables:** 8 (Rank, Title, Artist, Year, BPM, Genre, Release Date, Music Video)\n",
    "* **Most relevant variables:**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * **BPM:** Tracks a song’s tempo using beats per minute as a unit of measurement, defining the speed of the music (fast indicates a more energetic song while slow indicates a calmer song). In this project, a song having a tempo exceeding 120 BPM will be considered upbeat, high-energy music.\n",
    "    * **Genre:** Classifies songs based on overlapping musical characteristics (such as its instruments, rhythm, and mood). This dataset categorizes songs into the main umbrella categories of music, namely Pop, Hip-Hop, R&B, and Country as the dominant genres. This project will focus on charting songs that fall under the Pop genre. \n",
    "    * **Release Date:** Displays when a song was first released into the music industry. Since this project focuses on the season a song is released, we will convert these dates and categorize them based on whether they fall under spring, summer, fall, or winter. \n",
    "    * **Music Video:** Indicates whether a song has an associated official music video on YouTube (1 for Yes, 0 for No).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shortcomings:** Genres are a nuanced topic, where a song can be classified into numerous subcategories or contain mixtures of various genres. Therefore, our dataset is a more simplified version of the song’s characteristics, where we focus on categorizing the music based on the broader umbrella genres. Regarding release dates, due to some songs having newer versions or being re-released in more recent albums, the dataset displays the release date of the song depending on which version and from which album the song charted. For instance, if an older version of the song hit the charts compared to its updated one, we will list the release date of the older one. Similar to genres, music videos are also becoming more diverse and exclusive regarding what counts as a music video for a song. To simplify the data collection process for this project, we did not take into account lyric videos and mainly focused on the presence of more standard, traditional song music videos. Additionally, we referenced the actual video title to see if it explicitly includes the phrase “Music Video” to help us further determine whether we should count the song as having a music video or not.

    "This dataset contains over a decade-long collection of top songs from various genres (R&B, HipHop, Pop, & Country) that were featured on the Billboard Hot 100 Year-End Charts between 2015 and 2025. As mentioned earlier, we obtained our data from Wikipedia, SongBPM, and Youtube, since most of our metrics, such as genre, BPM, music video presence, and release date, could not be curated only by looking at the Billboard Year-End Charts. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Most Relevant Metrics:**  \n",
    "- **Chart Rank:** A pre-established  value from 1 to 100. In this context, a lower numerical value indicates a higher rank (e.g. A song that charted number 1 is considered higher ranking than a song that charted number 10).\n",
    "- **BPM:** A beats per minute measurement that indicates the tempo of a song. To determine the tempo of Pop songs in particular, we will use the following ranges: a slow/calm, low-energy song is typically less than 100 BPM, a mid range tempo is 100–120 BPM, and a fast/upbeat, high-energy song has a tempo greater than 120 BPM.\n",
    "- **Genre:** A column that generalizes and categorizes each song from its numerous sub-genres into a primary umbrella music genre, such as R&B, Hip-Hop, Pop, or Country.\n",
    "- **Release Date:** Following the YYYY-MM-DD format, this column will help us classify the release season of each song in the dataset. Specifically, we will observe the \"MM\" portion of the date to determine whether the song was released in the winter (12, 01, 02), spring (03, 04, 05), summer (06, 07, 08), or fall (09, 10, 11).  \n",
    "- **Music Video:** A binary representation (1/0) of the existence of an official YouTube music video, where 1 means Yes and 0 means No."

    "**Major Concerns with the Dataset:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Genre Simplification and Classification**  \n",
    "Although contemporary music spans a wide range of genres and subgenres, our analysis reduces this diversity into four broad categories: Pop, Hip-Hop, R&B, and Country. Each song was assigned to only one dominant category, even if it blended or was influenced by multiple stylistic elements. Subgenres were grouped under their broader parent genres (e.g., Trap under Hip-Hop), while genres less directly aligned with these four categories (e.g., Rock or Disco) were classified according to their closest stylistic or commercial association.  \n",
    "In cases involving fusion genres or derivative forms (e.g., Trap-Pop, Dance-Pop), or when a song spanned multiple broad categories (e.g., both Pop and Hip-Hop), classification was guided by the song’s dominant commercial positioning within the Billboard context rather than strict music-theoretical distinctions. In particular, because Pop as a category often functions as a broad commercial umbrella for music that appeals to a general audience, songs with cross-genre characteristics were categorized based on their primary market identity within the Billboard chart ecosystem.  \n",
    "While this coarse-grained classification improves analytical consistency and tractability, it also inevitably introduces subjectivity and collapses nuanced stylistic distinctions into broader categories.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Version Ambiguity in Release Date Identification**  \n",
    "Many songs exist in multiple versions, including remixes, collaborations, re-releases, edited editions, cover versions, etc. We would always choose the charted version of the song as the focal observation: When the original version charted, we collected data from the original version; and when a specific remix or collaboration version charted, we collected data from that specific charting version.  \n",
    "To ensure operational consistency and reproducibility, if multiple identical-content releases occurred (re-release of the exact same song), we selected the final release date prior to the song’s major rise in popularity to maintain temporal consistency with its chart performance. Despite these efforts, release dates may not perfectly correspond to the period during which a song accumulated the performance contributing to its Year-End ranking.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Strict Operational Definition of Official Music Videos**  \n",
    "Again, to ensure operational consistency and reproducibility, only videos explicitly labeled as “Official Music Video” or “Official Video” on YouTube were coded as present. Lyric videos, studio performances, live recordings, leaks, cancelled releases, and unofficial uploads were excluded.  \n",
    "While this strict operational definition reduces classification ambiguity, it may underestimate informal, unofficial digital virality, platform-driven exposure, or user-generated content that contributed to a song’s popularity (e.g., a viral TikTok video with the clip of a song causes the song to also go viral).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Reverse Causality Between Music Videos and Chart Rankings**  \n",
    "A central limitation concerns potential reverse causality between music video production and chart performance. \n",
    "In some cases, music videos are produced and released after a song has already begun gaining traction, functioning as a strategic supplement or reinforcement of rising popularity. Under such circumstances, it becomes difficult to determine whether music videos drive chart success, or whether chart success motivates video production.  \n",
    "Because this is an observational study using aggregated Year-End chart data, our findings should therefore be interpreted as associative rather than causal.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Tempo Measurement and Cross-Source Variability**  \n",
    "BPM values were obtained primarily from SongBPM and cross-checked from Tunebat when necessary. However, minor discrepancies across databases or differences between song versions (e.g., radio edits, remixes, half-time or double-time interpretations, and there are even songs with almost exact same title, cover, released on close dates, but has different BPM) may introduce measurement error.  \n",
    "Although efforts were made to match tempo values to the specific charting version (as stated in 2. Version Ambiguity in Release Date Identification above, the data is always selected from the specific charting version), BPM should be understood as an approximate musical indicator rather than a perfectly fixed structural constant.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Release Season and Popularity Timing Misalignment**  \n",
    "In the streaming era, songs frequently reach their peak popularity after months—or even years—of their initial release. As a result, release season may not fully capture the timing of chart-relevant success.  \n",
    "Our seasonal classification reflects the release timing, rather than the true period during which cumulative performance contributes to the Billboard Year-End ranking. This temporal misalignment limits the strength of our inferences regarding seasonal effects.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Seasonal Evergreen Songs and Recurring Chart Effects**  \n",
    "Certain cultural/ holiday-themed “evergreen” songs reappear on Year-End charts due to cyclical cultural consumption patterns. For example, All I Want for Christmas Is You and Rockin Around the Christmas Tree both have appeared repeatedly since 2020 (5 times in our dataset).  \n",
    "These recurring songs may inflate winter representation and reflect annual listening traditions rather than the classical release dynamics of contemporaneous songs.  \n",
    "While such songs were retained as part of the Billboard system to reduce subjectivity of data selection, they may introduce structural seasonality effects independent of release timing.  "

    "## Ethics \n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This project will not involve human subjects or user-level data. All data is collected from publicly available sources at the song or chart level, including Billboard Year-End Hot 100 rankings, Spotify audio features, and the presence of official YouTube music videos. Thus, informed consent from individuals is not applicable for our project.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> As mentioned above, the ideal data sets that we can use are Billboard End Year Hot 100 rankings, Spotify Audio Features (BPM), and Youtube (music videos). However, it only reflects commercially successful songs, which would be strongly affected by industry promotion, platform algorithms, and chart methodologies, etc. As a result, our findings are limited to only the commercially successful Pop songs. It cannot be generalized to all music. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We are only using general, publicly available information at the song or artist level. We are not going to collect or analyze any personal/user-level data, ensuring all data is organized and anonymous, minimizing privacy-related risks. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> As mentioned above in A.2, Our findings may reflect biases associated with commercial success and platform exposure, rather than the true inherent musical quality. If these biased findings were interpreted normatively, it might reinforce the existing industry advantage of the famous artists/ platforms with sufficient resources. To mitigate this, we will limit our conclusions strictly to commercially successful Pop songs, avoid any prescriptive or causal claims, and clearly stating the structural limitations of our dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Even though the information and data used in this project are from public platforms such as Billboard, Spotify, and YouTube, each website has rules and regulations about how their data can be used. So, we need to follow their terms of use by using these data for academic purposes only, and not share or sell the data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes, the data will only be used for academic purposes in this project, and it will be deleted right after this project ends (end of the UCSD 2026 Winter Quarter). \n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [ ] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The dataset we chose (online platforms) may favor certain artists, genres, or countries based on their promotion algorithms. These platform-specific biases may influence chart rankings and confound our conclusion of the relationships between the musical features (summer release dates, official YouTube music videos, and faster tempos) and success. Unfortunately, we can’t eliminate these biases (since ‘popular’ basically equals ‘commercially successful’), but we mitigate their impact by stating clearly that our analyzing result is limited strictly to commercially successful Pop songs and cannot be generalized to all music.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "> All of our data sources, processing steps, and analytical methods will be documented to support reproducibility and transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "> As mentioned above in the C.2 part, We will clearly state the limitations of our project and our chosen dataset, including the influence of marketing budgets, exposure, and platform algorithms that are not directly measurable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our project will not deploy a model or system in the real world, therefore, continuous monitoring is not applicable for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> There is a risk that findings may be misinterpreted as a prescriptive guidance for producing “success music”. Again, we would mitigate this by clearly stating that our conclusions are limited strictly to commercially successful Pop songs only, and framing our conclusions as descriptive and exploratory language, rather than normative language. \n"
