    "What determines the ranking of Pop songs in renowned music lists like the Billboard Hot 100 Year-End Charts? Through our investigation, we hope to identify potential factors that may be associated with chart positions of these top songs. Can a song’s BPM indicate a higher ranking? What about the presence of an official music video? Is it more likely for a song to gain more popularity if it is released in the summer over the winter? By answering these questions, we aim to explore what characteristics drive chart placements of Pop songs, one of the largest and most diverse genres in the music industry. \n",

    "In past research conducted by Nunes and Ordanini (2014)<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a><sup><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">1</a></sup>, they examined how the type of instrumentation in a Pop song affects their success on music charts. Specifically, they analyzed data from the Billboard Hot 100 Weekly Charts spanning 55 years, comparing number-one singles with songs that never climbed above rank 90 to determine what factors made number-one hits. Using Qualitative Comparative Analysis and Quantitative Regression techniques, Nunes and Ordanini found that the presence of background vocals was a necessary component consistently seen in number-one ranking Pop songs. Furthermore, their results suggested that in the 1960s and late 2000s, songs with relatively few instruments ranked higher in the charts. On the other hand, songs with relatively many instruments ranked higher during the 1970s–1990s. They also proposed that the songs that ranked number one on music charts like the Billboard Hot 100 were typically unique, set apart from the current era of music trends. These findings indicate that specific musical features can play a critical role in chart performance, which informs our investigation into how additional factors like tempo, release season, and official music video presence may also be associated with higher Billboard rankings.\n",

    "In a similar study, Kim and Oh (2021)<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a><sup><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">2</a></sup> examined the relationship between certain audio features and a song’s success on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. They analyzed over 6,000 songs that appeared on the weekly charts between 1998 and 2016, and used regression analysis and predictive modeling to find patterns in the music that made a difference in chart performance. Their results showed that songs that felt more energetic and easy to dance to were more likely to reach the top 10. In particular, tracks with a steady and powerful beat often ranked higher on the charts. They also discovered that songs with a positive mood tended to perform better than those that sounded dark or melancholic. These uplifting songs seemed to connect more quickly with listeners and remain popular for longer periods of time. The study further indicated that timbre could also make an impact, as songs with clearer or more distinctive sounds were more likely to stand out and achieve higher chart rankings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both studies above help shape how we think about our own research. Nunes and Ordanini focused more on musical structure, like how background vocals or instruments relate to chart success over time. Kim and Oh looked closely at how things like danceability and happiness affect chart performance. While these studies help show that the features inside a song matter, they don’t explore outside factors such as what time of year the song came out, or whether it has an official music video that may have increased its popularity. That’s where our project comes in. We’re combining factors including tempo, release season, and the presence of music videos to see how these things work together to influence a song’s ranking on the Billboard Hot 100 Year-End charts from 2015 to 2025. And in contrast to these previous studies, which focused on weekly charts and short-term song success, our study examines long-term chart success for Pop songs by analyzing Year-End charts instead.\n",

    "We predict that Pop songs with summer release dates, official YouTube music videos, and faster tempos are positively associated with higher Billboard yearly chart rankings from 2015 to 2025. Compared to those without videos, songs that have trending music videos may increase engagement and listening rates. Additionally, because summer is a socially active and highly favored season during which listeners often prefer upbeat, energetic music, Pop songs released during this period with faster tempos might gain more popularity, placing better ranks on lists such as the Billboard Hot 100 Year-End Charts."

    "  This dataset for our project would include all Pop songs that appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 Year End Charts between the years 2015 and 2025.Each observation would represent a single song appearing on the Year-End chart, resulting in approximately 1,100 observations (100 songs per year over 11 years). Since this study focuses on Pop music, non pop songs (hip hop, eletronic, R&B etc.) would be filtered out after gathering all 1,100 songs. The variables in our ideal dataset would include song title, artist (solo or group), chart rank, release date, release season, song tempo (BPM), and whether the song has an official YouTube music video. Release season would be determined by the relsease date.
    "  These data would ideally be stored in a tabular format, where each row represents a song and each column represents our variables (song name, artist, date, season, rank, bpm and music video). This structure would allow for efficient comparison and statistical analysis of how BPM, release season, and music video presence relate to chart rankings of top pop songs.  
    "  Billboard Year-End Hot 100 rankings would provide chart rank, song title, artist, and year. However, Billboard does not always provide detailed release dates or audio features. Wikipedia pages for individual songs can be used to obtain release dates and confirm the existence of official YouTube music videos, as many pages include direct links to the videos.
    "  SongBPM.com would be used to manually collect tempo (BPM) data for each song. While this website also provides additional musical data (key and duration) only BPM would be used for our project. No single dataset contains all of our agreed up and an nessary variables, data from Billboard, Wikipedia, SongBPM, and YouTube would need to be sourced and used collectively to gather all of our data.\n"
