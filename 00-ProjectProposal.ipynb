    "How are official YouTube music videos, song tempo, and release seasons of Pop songs associated with achieving higher chart rankings in the Billboard Hot 100 Year-End Charts between 2015 and 2025? In this study, we will take a closer look at these top ranking songs’ calendar release dates, average BPMs, and whether they have official music videos to determine if these factors are correlated with their Billboard chart positions."

    "What determines the ranking of Pop songs in renowned music lists like the Billboard Hot 100 Year-End Charts? Through our investigation, we hope to identify potential factors that may be associated with chart positions of these top songs. Can a song’s BPM indicate a higher ranking? What about the presence of an official music video? Is it more likely for a song to gain more popularity if it is released in the summer over the winter? By answering these questions, we aim to explore what characteristics drive chart placements of Pop songs, one of the largest and most diverse genres in the music industry. \n",

    "In past research conducted by Nunes and Ordanini (2014)<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a><sup><a href=\"#cite_note-1\">1</a></sup>, they examined how the type of instrumentation in a Pop song affects their success on music charts. Specifically, they analyzed data from the Billboard Hot 100 Weekly Charts spanning 55 years, comparing number-one singles with songs that never climbed above rank 90 to determine what factors made number-one hits. Using Qualitative Comparative Analysis and Quantitative Regression techniques, Nunes and Ordanini found that the presence of background vocals was a necessary component consistently seen in number-one ranking Pop songs. Furthermore, their results suggested that in the 1960s and late 2000s, songs with relatively few instruments ranked higher in the charts. On the other hand, songs with relatively many instruments ranked higher during the 1970s–1990s. They also proposed that the songs that ranked number one on music charts like the Billboard Hot 100 were typically unique, set apart from the current era of music trends. These findings indicate that specific musical features can play a critical role in chart performance, which informs our investigation into how additional factors like tempo, release season, and official music video presence may also be associated with higher Billboard rankings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a similar study, Kim and Oh (2021)<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a><sup><a href=\"#cite_note-2\">2</a></sup> examined the relationship between certain audio features and a song’s success on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. They analyzed over 6,000 songs that appeared on the weekly charts between 1998 and 2016, and used regression analysis and predictive modeling to find patterns in the music that made a difference in chart performance. Their results showed that songs that felt more energetic and easy to dance to were more likely to reach the top 10. In particular, tracks with a steady and powerful beat often ranked higher on the charts. They also discovered that songs with a positive mood tended to perform better than those that sounded dark or melancholic. These uplifting songs seemed to connect more quickly with listeners and remain popular for longer periods of time. The study further indicated that timbre could also make an impact, as songs with clearer or more distinctive sounds were more likely to stand out and achieve higher chart rankings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both studies above help shape how we think about our own research. Nunes and Ordanini focused more on musical structure, like how background vocals or instruments relate to chart success over time. Kim and Oh looked closely at how things like danceability and happiness affect chart performance. While these studies help show that the features inside a song matter, they don’t explore outside factors such as what time of year the song came out, or whether it has an official music video that may have increased its popularity. That’s where our project comes in. We’re combining factors including tempo, release season, and the presence of music videos to see how these things work together to influence a song’s ranking on the Billboard Hot 100 Year-End charts from 2015 to 2025. And in contrast to these previous studies, which focused on weekly charts and short-term song success, our study examines long-term chart success for Pop songs by analyzing Year-End charts instead.\n",

   "source": [
    "We predict that Pop songs with summer release dates, official YouTube music videos, and faster tempos are positively associated with higher Billboard yearly chart rankings from 2015 to 2025. Compared to those without videos, songs that have trending music videos may increase engagement and listening rates. Additionally, because summer is a socially active and highly favored season during which listeners often prefer upbeat, energetic music, Pop songs released during this period with faster tempos might gain more popularity, placing better ranks on lists such as the Billboard Hot 100 Year-End Charts."

    "* The dataset for our project would include all Pop songs that appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 Year End Charts between the years 2015 and 2025. Each observation would represent a single song appearing on the Year-End chart, resulting in approximately 1,100 observations (100 songs per year over 11 years). Since this study focuses on Pop music, non pop songs (hip hop, electronic, R&B etc.) would be filtered out after gathering all 1,100 songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The variables in our ideal dataset would include song title, artist (solo or group), chart rank, release date, release season, song tempo (BPM), and whether the song has an official YouTube music video. Release season would be determined by the release date.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Our data would ideally be stored in a tabular format, where each row represents a song and each column represents our variables (song name, artist, date, season, rank, BPM and music video). This structure would allow for efficient comparison and statistical analysis of how BPM, release season, and music video presence relate to chart rankings of top Pop songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Billboard Year-End Hot 100 rankings would provide chart rank, song title, artist, and year. However, Billboard does not always provide detailed release dates or audio features. Wikipedia pages for individual songs can be used to obtain release dates and confirm the existence of official YouTube music videos, as many pages include direct links to the videos.\n",

While this website also provides additional musical data (key and duration) only BPM would be used for our project. No single dataset contains all of our agreed upon/necessary variables.

    "## Ethics \n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This project will not involve human subjects or user-level data. All data is collected from publicly available sources at the song or chart level, including Billboard Year-End Hot 100 rankings, Spotify audio features, and the presence of official YouTube music videos. Thus, informed consent from individuals is not applicable for our project.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> As mentioned above, the ideal data sets that we can use are Billboard End Year Hot 100 rankings, Spotify Audio Features (BPM), and Youtube (music videos). However, it only reflects commercially successful songs, which would be strongly affected by industry promotion, platform algorithms, and chart methodologies, etc. As a result, our findings are limited to only the commercially successful Pop songs. It cannot be generalized to all music. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We are only using general, publicly available information at the song or artist level. We are not going to collect or analyze any personal/user-level data, ensuring all data is organized and anonymous, minimizing privacy-related risks. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> As mentioned above in A.2, Our findings may reflect biases associated with commercial success and platform exposure, rather than the true inherent musical quality. If these biased findings were interpreted normatively, it might reinforce the existing industry advantage of the famous artists/ platforms with sufficient resources. To mitigate this, we will limit our conclusions strictly to commercially successful Pop songs, avoid any prescriptive or causal claims, and clearly stating the structural limitations of our dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Even though the information and data used in this project are from public platforms such as Billboard, Spotify, and YouTube, each website has rules and regulations about how their data can be used. So, we need to follow their terms of use by using these data for academic purposes only, and not share or sell the data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes, the data will only be used for academic purposes in this project, and it will be deleted right after this project ends (end of the UCSD 2026 Winter Quarter). \n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [ ] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The dataset we chose (online platforms) may favor certain artists, genres, or countries based on their promotion algorithms. These platform-specific biases may influence chart rankings and confound our conclusion of the relationships between the musical features (summer release dates, official YouTube music videos, and faster tempos) and success. Unfortunately, we can’t eliminate these biases (since ‘popular’ basically equals ‘commercially successful’), but we mitigate their impact by stating clearly that our analyzing result is limited strictly to commercially successful Pop songs and cannot be generalized to all music.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "> All of our data sources, processing steps, and analytical methods will be documented to support reproducibility and transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "> As mentioned above in the C.2 part, We will clearly state the limitations of our project and our chosen dataset, including the influence of marketing budgets, exposure, and platform algorithms that are not directly measurable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our project will not deploy a model or system in the real world, therefore, continuous monitoring is not applicable for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> There is a risk that findings may be misinterpreted as a prescriptive guidance for producing “success music”. Again, we would mitigate this by clearly stating that our conclusions are limited strictly to commercially successful Pop songs only, and framing our conclusions as descriptive and exploratory language, rather than normative language. \n"
